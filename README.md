My personal website. Bio, my past and present research in physics and blog posts expounding different scientific ideas.

The website is currently under construction. The rest is to follow (hopefully) very quickly.

The following is a text to see if LaTeX is supported in this environment:
$$H = H_{0} + V = \sum\limits_{i}\varepsilon_{i}d^{\dagger}_{i}d_{i} + V$$
