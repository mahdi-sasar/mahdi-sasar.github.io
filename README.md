My personal website. Bio, my past and present research in physics and blog posts expounding different scientific ideas.
Despite the fact that a personal website is supposed to give an overview of one's professional capabilities (i.e. a verbose version of a CV), an important feature of **this** personal website will be the blogging aspect of it.

The website is currently under construction. The rest is to follow (hopefully) very quickly.
