<h1 class="title">Nanowire Field Emission for Lithography</h1>
</header>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
<p>I have done some interesting work in the past using field emission
from ZnO nanowires and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to <strong>clear</strong>
away any photoresist where the nanostructure is present. Of course, the
main idea belongs to my past PhD supervisor, when he himself was a PhD
student. However, we both made the mistake of using standard
photolithography photoresists to do these experiments. In fact, we
should have used <strong>e-beam lithography</strong> resins (or X-ray
lithography resins, which cure by the same principles as e-beam, using
secondary electron emissions after X-ray irradiation). E-beam resins
cure due to the polymerization (or the inverse of this depending on
whether we are talking about negative or positive resists) started by
the impacting electron. So, when we have a NiO thin film, I can grow a
sparse array of ZnO nanorods on it, while I can also enhance the
verticality by the idea here: [[Vertical ZnO Hydrothermal Growth Idea]].
Next, an e-beam resist (such as PMMA) can be used to coat the surface of
this layer. Then by pressing an anode to the top, we can force the ZnO
nanowires to emit electrons, acting basically as cold cathodes. Then,
the emitted electrons will cure the resin where the nanorods are and
when washed with the developer, we will have a perfect lithography
process. Everywhere is covered, but the tips of the nanorods.
Incidentally, this workflow can also be used to create UV LED from the
NiO/ZnO junction: [[UV LED from NiO-ZnO junction]].</p>
<p>This paper also has an innovative approach to extracting (cold
cathode) field emission from ZnO tetrapods. The overall geometry of the
cathode, anode and gate were interesting and might be useful for my
future device architecture.</p>

</ul>
<p>Another important thing to note is that PMMA is a positive tone
resist: wherever is exposed to electron beams is more easily dissolved.
This makes it perfect for our current applications. See this vendor for
such resists and the information therein for future reference.: <a href="https://www.allresist.com/resist-wiki-what-are-e-beam-resists-composed-of-and-how-do-they-work/">E-Beam
Resist</a> This idea can be further extended into <strong>X-ray
lithography</strong>. Currently, ASML’s fantastic design of EUV (see
[[ASML’s Extreme UV Laser]]) has a single handed monopoly on the market.
They have done a remarkable job and the final device, with an operating
wavelength of 13.5 nm, is a testament to decades of R&amp;D. X-rays were
always present in these years, but their application has been very
limited. Much more limited than the current benchmark of the
semiconductor industry of DUV lithography (deep UV lithography) which
uses excimer lasers. Main reason behind this is that most x-ray
lithography relies on x-ray emission from synchrotrons, and they are
very expensive and have a large footprint. Therefore, x-ray lithography
doesn’t seem to have been widely adopted for mass production in the
semiconductor industry. Challenges of x-ray lithography and their
resolution in my paradigm: 1. Infrastructure: X-ray lithography requires
the availability of synchrotron radiation or X-ray laser sources, which
are expensive and not easily accessible. &gt;Solution: &gt;My method of
cold cathode x-ray production removes the need for massive synchrotrons
and costly equipment. If done smartly, it can even be operated in
ambient pressure ([[nano gap vacuum tube concept]]). But initial
iterations can be done in high vacuum. 1. Throughput: The throughput of
X-ray lithography has historically been lower compared to other
lithography techniques, making it less suitable for high-volume
production. &gt;Solution: &gt;The throughput stands on the same level as
the EUV and DUV. The problem is in steering the focused light spot on
the resist layer. The EUV animations show that the XY scan happen by a
mechanical XY stage. These stages are probably high quality high
precision piezo actuators, and they must be used for these purposes as
well. 1. Cost: The infrastructure and equipment costs associated with
X-ray lithography have been a significant barrier to its widespread
adoption. &gt;Solution: &gt;The cost of cold cathode designs are very
low and they van be quickly replaced in case they sustain any damage.
They are built based on metal oxides and robust single crystal
nanostructures.</p>
